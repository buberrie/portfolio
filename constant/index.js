            <b>Building the Analytics Section:</b> The most challenging aspect
            was the bar chart in the analytics section. At the time, I was
            unfamiliar with libraries like Chart.js, and my instinct was to
            tackle the problem with CSS rather than immediately relying on
            external tools. This approach tested my problem-solving skills and
            allowed me to gain confidence in creating complex designs using CSS
            alone.

          <li className="list-disc">
            <b>Designing the Sidebar:</b> This was my first time working on a
            dashboard, and the lack of a mobile design in the provided Figma
            file inspired me to create a unique solution. Instead of a
            traditional hamburger icon, I designed a mini sidebar for mobile,
            which added a touch of originality to the project.
          </li>
          <li className="list-disc">
            <b>Building the Recent Orders Section:</b> I opted to use HTML table
            elements instead of CSS Grid, as I wanted to improve my proficiency
            with tables. This choice brought its own set of challenges, but
            ultimately, it enriched my understanding of structuring data within
            a web application.

          This project not only tested my technical abilities but also
